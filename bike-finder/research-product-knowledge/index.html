Samurai Armor

What makes this website stand out is the vast amount of drop down arrows for the user to interact with, far more customizations than on any other website. Next to every customization there is a question mark you can roll your cursor over to make a window appear going into detail about the selections. This store does not try to hide the price, as it’s high price points are front and center. Overall, this website confused me. I know I am not the target audience, but it feels liek the website is not appealing to look at and/ or use and needs to be more user friendly.
Gaming Laptop

Regardless of the computer model, all laptops on this website look relatively the same, so their images are not the main focus. Instead, Razor highlights their features, giving users the option to compare different makes and models. It is clear that this store focuses on their branding, as everything sticks to a black and green minimalistic theme.
Running Sneakers

Brooks stands out because of its use of animations. As you scroll or roll your cursor over a certain part of the page, a little doodle or new video appear. It is clear they are trying to sell an experience as opposed to just a pair of shoes. The site is also very focused on its looks, with a very clean, developed, white and blue look. It also puts reviews front and center, which is new. I think this site is by far the easiest and most user friendly yet.
Specialty Food
https://www.goldbelly.com
Whats interesting about Goldbelly is the product overload as you open the homepage. There are many different food options swarmed by bright colors. Goldbelly gives you options to search for food by many different criteria, almost as if it is for someone who doesn't know exactly what they are looking for. It also is the first website to make the prices small, seeming to hide them.
Overall
The features that are standard to all these websites are a search bar, add to cart and a banner at the top of the page to toggle through the website. Each website additionally has criteria to sort products by, although some far more advanced than others (ie. the Samurai website only had product categories, while Brooks could sort by the shoes width to the mileage you'd be using them to run).
Buying a Bike
https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/bicycle.html
According to this article, the three steps to buying a bike are figuring out what bike you want, factor in performance and cost, and then making sure the bike fits. It gives the type of bikes and what each is used for, the specific factors that can make a bike perform better or raise the price such as brake and gear sizes, and how to size a bike at home. Before reading this article, I was confused how to size a bike over the internet so it’s good they explained that.
I also looked on reddit, but the biking communities were super technical. This could be of use to someone who is very into biking and knows their stuff, but for someone like me, I think I would need to speak to someone directly for them to explain this to me.

Lastly, I read a NYT article that provided me with some useful information. They said that buying a bike from a local retailer may be more expensive, but it probably comes with maintenance that online may not. Also, buying online requires assembly, which some people probably won't enjoy. They talk about how Big Box stores like Walmart have cheap bikes, but the maintenance may end up totalling more than an expensive bike for an avid cycler. For a leisure cycler, on the other hand, they can work.
